    description: "The original Hyundai Kona Electric was one of the first mainstream electric crossovers, adapting the popular Kona platform for pure electric propulsion. Visually distinguished from the standard Kona by its closed-off grille, unique wheels, and slightly modified bumpers for improved aerodynamics, it maintained the distinctive split headlight design of its conventional counterpart. Initially offered with two battery options—a 39.2 kWh pack providing approximately 254 km (WLTP) range, and a more popular 64 kWh version delivering around 484 km (WLTP)—both paired with a front-mounted electric motor. The larger battery variant produced 201 HP (150 kW) and 291 lb-ft of torque, delivering surprisingly quick acceleration with 0-100 km/h times around 7.6 seconds. Charging capabilities included 100 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 47 minutes on the larger battery model. The interior was largely shared with the standard Kona but with EV-specific displays and controls, featuring a digital instrument cluster with power flow and efficiency information. A significant facelift in 2021 updated the exterior styling with a smoother front end and enhanced technology features. The first-generation Kona Electric was recognized for offering among the best range-per-dollar value in the EV market, making longer-range electric mobility accessible at a more mainstream price point."

    description: "The current Kona Electric features a complete redesign, now developed as an electric vehicle first with the internal combustion variants adapted from it—the reverse of the previous approach. Significantly larger than its predecessor, it offers improved passenger and cargo space while maintaining urban-friendly exterior dimensions. The exterior design incorporates a distinctive pixel-inspired light bar across the front, connecting the running lights (with the main headlights positioned lower in the bumper), and similar pixelated elements in the rear—styling cues shared with Hyundai's IONIQ dedicated electric vehicles. Available with either a 48.6 kWh standard-range battery offering approximately 340 km (WLTP) of range, or a 65.4 kWh long-range option providing up to 514 km (WLTP), both paired with a front-mounted electric motor. The long-range variant produces 201 HP (150 kW) and 188 lb-ft of torque, maintaining similar performance to its predecessor. Charging capabilities include up to 100 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in around 41 minutes for the larger battery. The interior represents a major advancement with a dual 12.3-inch panoramic display combining digital instruments and infotainment under a single piece of glass, ambient lighting, vehicle-to-load (V2L) capability for powering external devices, and improved sustainable materials. This generation builds upon the success of the original Kona Electric with enhanced technology, range, and interior space, continuing Hyundai's commitment to making electric mobility accessible across multiple market segments."
